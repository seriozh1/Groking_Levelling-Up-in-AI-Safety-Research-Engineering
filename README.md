## Notes

- **Progress Tracking**: Checkboxes will be marked (`- [x]`) as I complete each resource. Progress updates may be committed to this repository.  
- **Resources**: Some resources (e.g., Alignment Forum posts, LessWrong posts) are broad categories. I’ll select specific, relevant posts and document them in the repository as I progress.  
- **Feedback**: Suggestions for additional resources or improvements to this tracker are welcome via GitHub issues.  
- **Risks and Considerations**:  
  - Be cautious of advancing AI capabilities unintentionally, especially at higher levels; consult trusted AI Safety researchers if unsure.  
  - Find mentors and peers for support to avoid isolation and burnout.  
  - Avoid early over-specialization by exploring broadly initially, and late over-generalization by deepening expertise later.  
  - Stay updated as AI and AI Safety evolve rapidly; revisit earlier levels as needed.
